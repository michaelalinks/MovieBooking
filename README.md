# Movie Booking Web App
I focused more on the Azure side of things before we got the second instructor in so my web app is a bit less developed. The SQL script is quite long but I just used it to map out my tables and queries before I did it in my web app. Copy the path of index.html in the wwwroot folder into the browser search bar to test the frontend.

## Completed:
- Added 3 tables to DB
- Connected Azure SQL Database
- Connected web app to Azure App Service 
- Created a pipeline on Azure DevOps
- HTML and JavaScript to allow user to add to DB from browser

## Outstanding:
- Front end web design with styles (Just basic HTML at the minute)
- Tests
- Add data from Visual Studio within C# project (I added it from the DB using and SQL script but I made a start in my DbInitializer class)
